# Covid19-Intrepreter
The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused a global shortage of testing
kits, and it also increased new cases and fatalities. Predicting disease severity early is crucial to preventing fatalities, maximizing hospital resources,
and aiding clinicians’ decisions. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of ensemble learning strategies in image classification tasks with pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The rapid growth of deep learning has resulted in the emergence of pre-trained CNN architectures such as VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet, which score exceptionally well on different image recognition benchmarks. However, relying on a single model may not necessarily reflect the entire complexity of the underlying data distribution. Ensemble learning, which combines the predictions of numerous models, is a potential strategy for improving predictive performance. We ran trials using three commonly used pre-trained CNN models: VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet, which were trained on a dataset of images from three classes. The dataset was used to 
fine-tune each model, and their performance was evaluated on a separate test. Furthermore, we studied decision-level fusion strategies for aggregating predictions from these models, resulting in an ensemble model. Our evaluation measures comprised classification precision, recall, accuracy and F1 score, as well as confusion
matrices. The results show that, while individual pre-trained CNN models are highly accurate, ensemble learning techniques can improve predictive
performance even further. The ensemble model outperformed individual models, demonstrating higher accuracy and robustness in picture classification tests. This paper sheds light on the efficacy of ensemble learning using pre-trained CNN models and demonstrates its potential for increasing classification performance in a variety of real-world applications, including medical diagnosis, object recognition, and remote sensing.The experimental results suggest that the proposed fusion method is effective, with better classification accuracy when compared to separate models. This study provides useful insights on using deep learning models and fusion procedures to improve image classification performance. Future research directions include looking into more advanced ensemble approaches and the transferability of models across domains.
